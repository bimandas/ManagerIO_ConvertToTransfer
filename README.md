This is a tool to convert payment/receipts into transfers in manager.io

It only uses payments/receipts that contain one line of transaction inside.  ie. freshly imported transactions.

The exchange rate is only checked when transfering from accounts with different currencies.

A backup is created whenever you click "save".  Remove them when you're confident that it's all ok.
